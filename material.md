### Basic Operating System

### Version Control System
Version Control System (VCS) typically are used to help development purpose. With VCS, you can track changes across many developers in a different time and help manage large project. You can also revert changes that are made, collaborate in a project, analyzing existing project based on its change, and many more.
#### Git
There are many VCS that exist in the wild, but the most widely used one is Git. Created in 2005 by the maker of Linux, Linus Torvalds, Git are used in many projects, and even companies all around the world. Git originally designed for coordinating work among programmers coperating on open source code during software development.

 - Git References (https://git-scm.com/docs)
#### Git Hosting Service
Many open source project are hosted publicly so that anyone can see and contribute to the project. They usually hosted it in a Git hosting service, which is free for most features. You can also publish your own project too and create your own portofolio there.

### Database
Learning database is important for backend developer as database are an important part of an application. By learning database, you can manage the data of your user and managing how your application take data in a way that can solve some specific request.
#### Database Theory
Database theory is the basic knowledge to learn about database. We recommend you to learn it before learning about database management system.
[Link](https://www.w3schools.in/dbms/intro/)
#### SQL
SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system. SQL is particularly useful in handling structured data, something like data that contains relations among entities and variables.
[Link](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
 - PostgreSQL
 - MySQL
#### NoSQL
 A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. NoSQL data are incresingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL systems are also sometimes called "Not only SQL" to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages or sit alongside SQL databases.

### API Theory
Understanding how the API works is a good practice to do before jumping directly to the language-specific implementation. By learning the specification of the API itself, you should be able to implement it easier regardless of what language you use. There will be some examples provided too in this category.
